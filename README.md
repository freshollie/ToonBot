# ToonBot
ToonBot was a GUI run inside of Disneys Toontown and was used to run scripts designed to advance the players state in the game.

I created this repository mearly for reference. These programs are no longer usable as the game was shutdown in September 2013.

I am freshollie and I created videos about these scripts during 2013 on the youtube channel:
